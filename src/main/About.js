        The Academic Student Course Registration System is a web-based application designed to streamline the process of course registration for students in an academic institution. It serves as a centralized platform where students can view available courses, select their preferred courses, and register for the upcoming semester. The system aims to simplify course enrolment, prevent scheduling conflicts, and ensure that students have access to the courses they need to progress in their academic journey.

Admins are like the managers of the system. They handle important behind-the-scenes tasks to keep everything running well. Here's what they do:
Taking Care of Users: Admins manage the accounts of everyone using the system, making sure only the right people can access it.
Courses Management: They update and organize the list of courses that students can choose from, making sure all the information is accurate.
Planning Schedule: Admins set up the dates and times for classes, making sure there are no overlaps that could confuse students.
Keeping Data Safe: They make sure all the data in the system is safe and protected, so nothing important gets lost.
Helping Out: If someone has trouble using the system, admins are there to help and make things right.<br/>

<b><u>Student Module :</u></b>
This part is all about the students. They use the system to pick the classes they want to take. Here's how it works:
Exploring Courses: Students can look at all the different classes available and get details about what each one is about.
Signing Up: They choose the classes they want and sign up for them, all online.
Avoiding Problems: If there's a situation where their classes might clash, the system will let them know so they can change their choices.
Sharing Thoughts: Students can share what they think about the registration process to help make it even better.<br/>

<b><u>Faculty Module :</u></b>
This part is for the teachers. They use the system to manage the courses they're teaching. Here's what they do:
Course Control: Teachers can see which courses they're in charge of and update any information about them.
Staying in Touch: They can send messages to their students, share assignments, and important stuff about the class.
Seeing Students: Teachers can see who's in their class, helping them get ready for teaching.</p>
